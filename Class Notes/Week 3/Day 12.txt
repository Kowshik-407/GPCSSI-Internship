GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation
Speaker - Mr. Prashant Mali


The UK GDPR sets out seven key principles:
Lawfulness, fairness and transparency.
Purpose limitation.
Data minimisation.
Accuracy.
Storage limitation.
Integrity and confidentiality (security)
Accountability.

GDPR is important because it improves the protection of European data subjects' rights and clarifies what companies that process personal data must do to safeguard these rights. All companies and organisations that deal with data relating to EU citizens must comply by the new GDPR.
